                For example: there exists "<p>This is an <b>Name</b>.</p> <p>This is a <strong>App</strong> project. </p>" in the TextArea. By Adding "Name" as the “Variable” and <b>Html Editor</b> as the “Value”, also "App" as "Variable" and "Blazor" as "Value, the HTML will be changed to “<p>This is an <b>Html Editor</b></p><p>This is a <strong>Blazor</strong> project. </p>”
