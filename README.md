You can preview the result at the bottom of the page. By clicking submit button, the page is navigated to the HTML file that is generated.

            <div>
                For example: there exists "<span>This is an <b>Name</b>.</span> <span>This is a <strong>App</strong> project. </span>" in the TextArea. By Adding "Name" as the “Variable” and Html Editor as the “Value”, also "App" as "Variable" and "Blazor" as "Value, the HTML will be changed to “<span>This is an <b>Html Editor</b></span> <span>This is a <strong>Blazor</strong> project. </span>”
